This repo is for experimenting with various techniques for displaying images on a RGB LED Matrix
There are several versions of Python files that demonstrate some of the ways an image can be shown.

image_view.py is the original version of this project and goes through a bunch of different logos and they move around the screen, bouncing at the edges.


flyingpig.py demonstrates an animation by quickly going through a bunch of images of pig flapping its wings in succession much like a flip book.

avengers.py demonstrates going through a bunch of different full screen images in order.


oregon.py is similar to image_view.py but uses a timer to track elapsed time since the last time a new image is randomly loaded.

octocats.py selects a random .jpg image from our octocats family and then demos a vertical or horizontal screenwipe effect.
